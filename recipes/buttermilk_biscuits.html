    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter,<br>chilled in freezer and cut into thin slices</li>
        <li>¾ cup cold buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons buttermilk for brushing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).<br>
            Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.<br>
            Add cold butter slices and cut into the flour with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the mixture.<br>
            Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just combined.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.</li>
        <li>Fold the rectangle in thirds.<br>
            Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle.<br>
            Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.</li>
        <li>Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick.<br>
            Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits.<br> 
            Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet.<br>
            Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb.<br>
            Brush buttermilk over the tops.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and golden brown, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
