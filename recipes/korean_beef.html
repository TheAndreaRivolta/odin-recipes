    <h2>Go talk to your friendly neighborhood butcher,<br>
        tell them you want some flanken-style beef short ribs,<br>
        and give this great grill technique a try.
    </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large Asian pear, peeled, cored and sliced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sherry wine</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅛ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>5 slices fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>4 pounds beef short ribs, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 chopped green onion for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix pear slices, sherry wine, soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, garlic,<br>
            ginger, hoisin sauce, hot chili paste, and sesame oil<br>
            in a blender until smooth, about 4 minutes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Arrange short ribs in a 9x13-inch baking dish and coat completely with marinade.<br>
             Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 8 to 12 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Remove short ribs to a plate and blot dry with paper towel to remove excess marinade.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Grill short ribs until firm, hot, and slightly pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side.<br>
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Lovely tip</h3>
